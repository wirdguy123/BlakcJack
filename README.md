This is just a quick program I made to get better at coding in python and coding in general. I plan to update it later with cooler fetures (and fix the deck, I forgot ones don't exist).
There are still a couple bugs that need to be fixed but for a newby like me to have made this in >15 hours, I'm proud of my self.
I usaly don't publish work, but I have been, "To get into the programing buisness you need to netwrok", so here I am with this.
